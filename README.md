Building
--------
First, you'll need to install node.js, then install `coffee-script` and `uglifyjs` from npm.

To build MyConbook, link `conbook.json` from a [DataTool](https://github.com/MyConbook/datatool) output into the `www` directory, put your maps into the `www/maps` directory, and run `./build.sh`. Then serve content out of the `www` directory.
